# Daily Diary Hub Full Stack Web Dev Project

Daily Diary Hub will be a web app that allows users to write a short note about how their day went. Each Entry is stored so that users can scroll back and look at what they have written before. The app is meant to inspire daily positivity so it will have customizable themes and rotating positive messages displayed when the user logs in.
